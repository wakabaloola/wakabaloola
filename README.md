## Background

DPhil in String Theory with research experience on quantum field theory, string theory and quantum gravity projects. (Previous work at Tata Institute for Fundamental Research (TIFR) in Mumbai, Imperial College London, and the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich.)
  <!-- Experience in training a wide variety of AI models (DataAnnotation Tech) on coding, maths and physics. -->

## Technical Interests

  - Broadly, I am interested in intricate structures with real-world applications.
  - All branches of mathematics (including stats and probabilities, stochastic calculus, differential geometry, group theory, complex analysis, ...), real-world applications in quantitative finance, and physics (including quantum field theory, superstring theory, quantum gravity).
  - As far as programming languages are concerned, I like to think that I use those appropriate for the task at hand.  Due to the vast number of excellent available libraries, I end up using Python most of the time (Django, Numpy, Pandas, SciPy, etc.). I am also a RUST fan.

## What I’m Currently Working On

I am developing a quantitative finance platform, `quantsuite.io`, using Django. The design emphasis is on real-time trading, analytics, and strategy execution. It integrates Celery for handling background tasks (like backtesting and market data processing), Redis for fast in-memory data storage and task queuing, and WebSockets (powered by Django Channels) to deliver live updates such as order book changes, trade executions, and portfolio metrics. The architecture emphasizes low latency, scalability, and a responsive user experience, making it suitable for professional trading and risk management environments. Stay tuned for updates.
