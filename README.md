## Background

  - DPhil in String Theory with extensive research experience on quantum field theory, string theory and quantum gravity projects.
  - Previous work at Tata Institute for Fundamental Research (TIFR), Imperial College London and the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich. 
  - Experience in training a wide variety of AI models (DataAnnotation Tech) on coding, maths and physics.  

## Technical Interests

  - Python as my primary programming language (backend development).  
  - Strong interest in all branches of mathematics (including stats and probabilities, differential geometry, complex analysis, ...) and physics (including quantum field theory, superstring theory, quantum gravity), and (in particular) applications thereof.
  - Experience with **MATLAB**, **Mathematica**, **UNIX**, and am currently learning **Rust**.

## What I’m Currently Working On

  - I am currently developing a short-term contrarian quantitative trading project --stay tuned for updates on that!

## Collaborations & Interests

  - Open to teaming up on challenging projects in finance, data science, or research-oriented development.  
  - I also have interest and experience in building game mechanics (board games, rule design).
  - Feel free to drop me a message if you would like to have a chat!
