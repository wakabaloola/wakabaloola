I am a **High-Energy Physicist Researcher** turned **Python Developer**, passionate about solving complex problems through analytical insight and creative thinking. 

- **Background**:  
  - DPhil in String Theory with experience in Quantum Gravity research and advanced computational methods.  
  - Previous work at TIFR (Mumbai) and Imperial College London, focusing on cutting-edge theoretical physics (quantum gravity in superstring theory).
  - Experience in training a wide variety of AI models (DataAnnotation Tech) on coding, maths and physics.  

- **Technical Interests**:  
  - **Python** as my primary programming language (backend development, data analysis).  
  - Strong grounding in **mathematics** (including stats and probabilities, differential geometry, complex analysis, ...) and **physics** (including quantum field theory, superstring theory, quantum gravity).
  - Experience with **MATLAB**, **Mathematica**, **UNIX**, and am currently learning **Rust**.  

- **What I’m Working On**:  
  - I am currently developing a sort-term contrarian quantitative trading project --stay tuned for updates on that!

- **Collaborations & Interests**:  
  - Open to teaming up on challenging projects in finance, data science, or research-oriented development.  
  - I also have interest and experience in building game mechanics (board games, rule design).  

- **Get in Touch**:  
  - Feel free to reach out at [wakabaloola@gmail.com](mailto:wakabaloola@gmail.com).  

Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding!
