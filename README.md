- 👋 Hi, I’m @wakabaloola, I am new at github.
- 👀 I have been working on many aspects of high energy physics, quantum gravity, superstring theory, mathematics, boardgames and rule-building, 
and more broadly I am interested in challenging projects involving a broad and analytical toolset.
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my Python and Stochastic Calculus toolset.
- 💞️ I am open to collaborate on projects.
- 📫 You can reach me at wakabaloopa@gmail.com
