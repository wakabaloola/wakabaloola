## Background

  - DPhil in String Theory with research experience on quantum field theory, string theory and quantum gravity projects.
  - Previous work at Tata Institute for Fundamental Research (TIFR), Imperial College London and the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich. 
  - Experience in training a wide variety of AI models (DataAnnotation Tech) on coding, maths and physics.  

## Technical Interests

  - Broadly, I am interested in intricate structures with real-world applications.
  - All branches of mathematics (including stats and probabilities, stochastic calculus, differential geometry, group theory, complex analysis, ...) and physics (including quantum field theory, superstring theory, quantum gravity).
  - I like to think that I use the programming language appropriate for the task at hand. Much of my experience is in Python (Django, Numpy, Pandas, SciPy, etc.), I am a RUST fan.

## What I’m Currently Working On

  - I am currently developing a quantitative finance platform, `quantsuite.io`,  stay tuned for updates.
