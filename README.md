# Hi there, I'm Dimitri! 

I am a **High-Energy Physics Researcher** turned **Python Developer**, passionate about solving complex problems through analytical insight and creative thinking. 

- **Background**:  
  - DPhil in String Theory with experience in Quantum Gravity research and advanced computational methods.  
  - Previous work at TIFR (Mumbai) and Imperial College London, focusing on cutting-edge theoretical physics.  

- **Technical Interests**:  
  - **Python** as my primary programming language (backend development, data analysis).  
  - Experience with **MATLAB**, **Mathematica**, **UNIX**, and am currently learning **Rust**.  
  - Strong grounding in **mathematics** and **physics**, with a knack for tackling tricky problems.  

- **What I’m Working On**:  
  - Contributing to projects that require robust quantitative analysis.  
  - Training AI models (DataAnnotation Tech) and staying curious about innovative applications of machine learning.  

- **Collaborations & Interests**:  
  - Always open to teaming up on challenging projects in data science, scientific computing, or research-oriented development.  
  - Interested in building game mechanics (board games, rule design) and exploring creative pursuits (wildlife photography, watercolor painting).  

- **Get in Touch**:  
  - Feel free to reach out at [wakabaloola@gmail.com](mailto:wakabaloola@gmail.com).  
  - Let’s connect if you have a project in mind or just want to talk about the wonders of quantum fields, Python, or new board game ideas!

Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding!
