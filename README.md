- Hi, Iâ€™m Dimitri.  I am interested in developing and contributing to quantitative analysis and research projects.
- I have a background in high energy physics research, I did my doctorate in string theory and have worked on numerous string theory and quantum gravity projects throughout my early career. 
- I have a strong passion for getting involved in challenging projects requiring a broad and analytical toolset, I am interested to collaborate on projects.
- Python is currently my main programming language of choice, but I have a working familiarity with various other programming languages (such as UNIX, MATLAB, and I am learning Rust.)
- I also have various hobbies, including boardgame and rule building, wildlife photography, watercolour painting.
